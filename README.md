**Instructions for use**

Input a target into the command line either, braille, ascii, or unicode to determine
which kind of translation you are trying to do. Then, you enter the source you want to translate. This occurs in the form "target" "source"

The translations you can do includes braille, which converts text into 6-bit strings
corresponding with its braille character. ascii, which converts 6-bit strings representing braille characters into their corresponding ascii characters. Finally, you can call unicode to converts ascii characters into braille characters.
